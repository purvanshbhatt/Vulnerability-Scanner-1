**Security Vulnerabilities Scanner**
This Python script automates the process of vulnerability scanning using a variety of security scanning tools to check for vulnerabilities in a target IP address. It generates a report of the scan results, which includes the total number of vulnerabilities checked, the number of flaws detected, and the time elapsed to complete the scan. The report also classifies the vulnerabilities into four categories: informational, low, medium, and high.

Installation
Clone the repository:

**git clone https://github.com/your-username/security-vulnerabilities-scanner.git**

Install the required dependencies:
**pip install -r requirements.txt**

Run the script with the target IP address as an argument:

**python scanner.py <target_ip_address>**

The script will generate a report file titled scan_results.txt in the current directory.

Example Usage

**python scanner.py 192.168.1.10**
This will scan the IP address 192.168.1.10 and generate a report file titled scan_results.txt.
