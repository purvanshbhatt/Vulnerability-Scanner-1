# Vulnerability Scanner

This project is a Python-based vulnerability scanner designed to identify potential security issues in a target system. It performs various checks to detect vulnerabilities and generates comprehensive reports to help you address them.

## Features

- **Multi-Tool Integration**: Utilizes multiple security tools to perform in-depth vulnerability assessments.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed reports highlighting the identified vulnerabilities and suggesting mitigations.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable to include additional security checks and tools.
- **Debug Logs**: Provides extensive logging for debugging purposes.

## Files in the Repository

- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `README.md`: Documentation file you are currently reading.
- `monitor.py`: Script to monitor and log system activities.
- `scanner.py`: Core script for scanning and identifying vulnerabilities.
- `.github/workflows/python-app.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and testing.

## Installation

To install and set up the vulnerability scanner, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vulnerability-scanner.git
   cd vulnerability-scanner
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the scanner:**
   ```sh
   python scanner.py
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Scanner

To run the scanner, execute the following command:

```sh
python scanner.py
```

You can specify additional options and configurations by modifying the script or passing arguments as needed.

### Monitoring Activities

To monitor and log system activities, use the `monitor.py` script:

1. **Install additional dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install watchdog psutil
   ```

2. **Set the path to monitor:**
   ```sh
   export MONITOR_PATH=/path/to/directory
   ```

3. **Run the monitor script:**
   ```sh
   python monitor.py
   ```

#### Features of the Updated `monitor.py` Script

- **Enhanced Logging**: Utilizes the `logging` module for better log management.
- **File Monitoring**: Uses the `watchdog` library to monitor file system changes such as creation, modification, and deletion of files.
- **Network Monitoring**: Uses the `psutil` library to monitor network connections, logging established connections.
- **Process Monitoring**: Uses the `psutil` library to track new process creation, logging newly started processes.
- **Configuration**: Reads the path to monitor from an environment variable `MONITOR_PATH`.
